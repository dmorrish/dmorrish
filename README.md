Hi, I’m Deryk.

I graduated from the University of Waterloo's first class of Mechatronics Engineering. I'm a professor at Northern College of Applied Science and Technology in Timmins, Ontario where I teach in the Electrical Engineering Technology program.

From 2017 to 2023 I helped build 3i0 Inc, an Electrical Engineering business that specialises in Power Systems Protection and Control.

My current project is to learn as much as I can about machine learning.
