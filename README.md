Hi, Iâ€™m Deryk.

I graduated from the University of Waterloo's first class of Mechatronics Engineering. I'm a professor at Northern College of Applied Arts and Technology in Timmins, Ontario where I teach in the Electrical Engineering Technology program.

From 2017 to 2023 I helped build [3i0 Inc](https://www.3i0.ca/), an Electrical Engineering business that specializes in Power Systems Protection and Control.

My current project is a webapp to help my students practice electrical circuits theory.
